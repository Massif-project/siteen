# Objectives
The MASSIF project aims to develop and test solutions to overcome these bottlenecks, ranging from the design of automated diagnostic tools to real-time data visualization and analysis.

- Produce the resources required for expert identification of pollinators, xylophagous, and saproxylic insects (reference collections, morphological identification, molecular barcoding, photographic databases)
- Develop artificial intelligence–based solutions to automate identification both in the laboratory and in the field
- Design sensors and instruments to automate trapping systems and move toward non-lethal approaches
- Standardize trapping methods to enable large-scale deployment
- Develop and configure digital solutions for real-time data sharing and visualization
