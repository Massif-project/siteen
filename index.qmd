# The MASSIF project

:::

<br>
MASSIF is a research project dedicated to monitoring and tracking insect fauna diversity in forests. It is funded under the framework of the [PEPR FORESTT](https://www.pepr-forestt.org/){target=“_blank”} (2025-2029). The project brings together 9 partner units affiliated with 6 parent institutions.

# Context
Characterizing the current collapse of biodiversity requires the establishment of long-term monitoring observatories. Insects, which constitute a major component of biodiversity, play a key role in numerous ecosystem services, yet certain pest species also pose a threat to forest health. To date, no standardized solution exists, and several technological bottlenecks continue to hinder the implementation of effective monitoring and biosurveillance systems for insect fauna.

# Objectives
The MASSIF project aims to develop and test solutions to overcome these bottlenecks, ranging from the design of automated diagnostic tools to real-time data visualization and analysis.

- Produce the resources required for expert identification of pollinators, xylophagous, and saproxylic insects (reference collections, morphological identification, molecular barcoding, photographic databases)
- Develop artificial intelligence–based solutions to automate identification both in the laboratory and in the field
- Design sensors and instruments to automate trapping systems and move toward non-lethal approaches
- Standardize trapping methods to enable large-scale deployment
- Develop and configure digital solutions for real-time data sharing and visualization

# Expected Outcomes
- The MASSIF project will provide resources for entomofauna identification by combining molecular data, photographic databases, and analytical algorithms.
- It will contribute to overcoming the technological bottlenecks that currently limit large-scale monitoring of forest insects.
- It will develop the tools necessary for monitoring insect fauna and forest health, complementing the data collected in the targeted X-RISKS and MONITOR projects.
